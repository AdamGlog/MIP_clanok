  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has profoundly impacted many areas of machine learning. However, it took a while for its impact to be felt in the field of recommender systems. In this article, we outline some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in using deep learning for recommender systems at Netflix. We first provide an overview of the various recommendation tasks on the Netflix service. We found that different model architectures excel at different tasks. Even though many deep-learning models can be understood as extensions of existing (simple) recommendation algorithms, we initially did not observe significant improvements in performance over well-tuned non-deep-learning approaches. Only when we added numerous features of heterogeneous types to the input data, deep-learning models did start to shine in our setting. We also observed that deep-learning methods can exacerbate the problem of offline–online metric (mis-)alignment. After addressing these challenges, deep learning has ultimately resulted in large improvements to our recommendations as measured by both offline and online metrics. On the practical side, integrating deep-learning toolboxes in our system has made it faster and easier to implement and experiment with both deep-learning and non-deep-learning approaches for various recommendation tasks. We conclude this article by summarizing our take-aways that may generalize to other applications beyond Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract   = {This article discusses the various algorithms that make up the Netflix recommender system, and describes its business purpose. We also describe the role of search and related algorithms, which for us turns into a recommendations problem as well. We explain the motivations behind and review the approach that we use to improve the recommendation algorithms, combining A/B testing focused on improving member retention and medium term engagement, as well as offline experimentation using historical member engagement data. We discuss some of the issues in designing and interpreting A/B tests. Finally, we describe some current areas of focused innovation, which include making our recommender system global and language aware.},

  abstract = {Recommender systems are traditionally optimized to facilitate content discovery for consumers by ranking items based on predicted relevance. As such, these systems often do not consider the varying profitability of items for service providers. Since the purpose of recommender systems is usually to create value for both consumers and providers, we hypothesize that integrating profit awareness into recommender systems, considering both consumer relevance and provider profitability, can enhance recommendation outcomes from a provider point of view. In this study, we design and evaluate novel modeling approaches for different families of collaborative filtering algorithms to overcome the existing limitations of conventional reranking methods. Specifically, we show how to embed the business value perspective directly into the loss functions during model training. Through empirical evaluations on three datasets, we show that our proposed models effectively generate recommendations that balance profitability and relevance. Overall, our analyses indicate that these models offer a promising alternative to traditional reranking approaches, particularly because they exhibit improved efficiency during prediction.}

This research paper tries to answer all the questions related to the how the database of aesthetic visual analysis (AVA), an image selection tool works better or more like humans. To further substantiate the popularity of Netflix, a real time data of 307 respondents who use OTT platforms in Delhi was collected to determine whether Netflix in fact is or not the market leader. 63.8% of them selected Netflix as their top option.},
